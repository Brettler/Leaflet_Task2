# Advanced Programmin 2 - Task 1 Part 2
Eden Berman & Liad Brettler

## Description
This project involved creating a chat webpage app with three different displays: a Login page, a Register page, and a Chats page. To design these pages, we made use of CSS and Bootstrap, while React was used to implement the app's functionality.
It is worth mentioning that the app is currently unable to receive messages from other users because it's not yet connected to a web server. Our main goal for this project was to establish the webpage's functionality, rather than its connection to external servers.

## Instructions
To start using the app, go to the directory where the files are located in your terminal and enter the command "npm start". This will launch the app and open the login page in your browser. The login page is the main interface where you can enter your username and password. After clicking on the "Login" button, registered users will be directed to their personalized Chats page. If you haven't registered yet, click on the "Register" button, which will take you to the registration page where you can provide your information. Once you have filled in all the required fields, click on the "Register" button to redirect to the login page.
Once you are in the Chats page, you will see a split-screen interface. The left side displays your chats with your friends, while the right side shows the chat that you are currently viewing. To log out, click on the door icon on the top left bar. This will redirect you back to the login page.

To close the app, use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+C" and then type "Y" to confirm.
